K2_FLEXSLIDER_XML_DESCRIPTION="<div style="width:60%">K2 FlexSlider module is a product of template-help.com team and a combination of K2 Content Module and FlexSlider jQuery plugin.<br/><br/>
FlexSlider was built to serve up the best responsive jQuery slider around. I had built a few implementations of responsive sliders on different client projects and noticed that there was a glaring hole for plugin support with the concept. I wanted to build a plugin that would serve the newest of beginners, while providing seasoned developers a tool they could use with confidence. What has come forth is this, FlexSlider. I plan to maintain this plugin and provide support to users implementing FlexSlider into their sites. Responsive web design can be tricky, but I hope that FlexSlider serves to uncomplicate the process, just a little bit.<br/><br/>K2 Content is the primary &quot;content&quot; retrieval module for K2. You can set various category and item element filters to display a number of items coming from the K2 component. Using multiple copies of this module (with varying settings) you can achieve complex news publishing/magazine site layouts.</div>"
